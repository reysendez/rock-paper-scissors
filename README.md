# rock-paper-scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game made from JavaScript.

I used simple if/else statements for the CPU generated player while I used a do/while loop to make this a 5-round game as specificed by The Odin Project.
This was my very first dip into Javascript, there's quite a lot to learn about the language and how it ties into HTML and CSS in web development but I am ready to keep learning and receiving.
